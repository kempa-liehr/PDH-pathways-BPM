\subsection*{Background and purpose}
Healthcare pathways define the execution sequence of clinical activities as patients move through a treatment process, and they are critical for maintaining quality of care. The aim of this study is to investigate the utilization of business process modelling (BPM) to design an adaptive healthcare pathway mining methodology, with particular emphasis on producing pathway models that are easy to interpret for clinicians without a sufficient background in process mining.

\subsection*{Method}
This study utilizes the business process-mining software ProM to design a process mining pipeline for healthcare pathway discovery, conformance analysis, and enrichment using hospital records. The efficacy of the BPM approach is demonstrated via two case studies that apply the proposed process mining pipeline to discover appendicitis and cholecystitis 
pathways from hospital records. Machine learning methodologies based on probabilistic programming are utilised to explore pathway features that influence patient recovery time.

\subsection*{Results}
The produced appendicitis and cholecystitis 
pathway models are
easy for clinical interpretation and provides an unbiased overview of patient movements through the treatment process. Analysis of the discovered pathway model enables reasons for longer than usual treatment times to be explored and deviations from standard treatment pathways to be identified. A probabilistic regression model that estimates patient recovery time based on the information extracted by the process mining pipeline is developed and has the potential to be very useful for hospital scheduling purposes.

\subsection*{Conclusion}
This study establishes the application of the business process modelling tool ProM for the improvement of healthcare pathway mining methods. 
%There is also value in investigating the capabilities of other business process modelling tools for healthcare pathway mining purposes. 
The proposed pipeline for healthcare pathway discovery  has the potential to support the development of machine learning models to further relate healthcare pathways to performance indicators such as length of post operation stay.
