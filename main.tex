\begin{abstract}
Healthcare pathways define the execution sequence of clinical
activities as patients move through a treatment process, and they are
critical for maintaining quality of care.
The aim of this study is to investigate the utilization of business process modelling (BPM) to design an adaptive healthcare pathway mining methodology, with particular emphasis on producing pathway models that are easy to interpret for clinicians without a sufficient background in process mining.
The efficacy of the BPM approach is demonstrated via two case studies
that apply the proposed process mining pipeline to discover
appendicitis and cholecystitis pathways from hospital records.
The produced pathway models are
easy for clinical interpretation and provide an unbiased overview of
patient movements through the treatment process.
A probabilistic regression model that estimates patient recovery time based on the information extracted by the process model is developed and has the potential to be very useful for hospital scheduling purposes.
