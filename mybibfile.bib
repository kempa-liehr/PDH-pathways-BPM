abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the need for solving hospital-wide patient scheduling problems. Inpatient scheduling, patient activities have to be scheduled on scarce hospital resources such that temporal relations between activities (e.g. for recovery times) are ensured. Common objectives are, among others, the minimization of the length of stay (LOS). In this paper, we consider a hospital-wide patient scheduling problem with LOS minimization based on uncertain clinical pathways. We approach the problem in three stages: First, we learn most likely clinical pathways using a sequential pattern mining approach. Second, we provide a mathematical model for patient scheduling and finally, we combine the two approaches. In an experimental study carried out using real-world data, we show that our approach outperforms baseline approaches on two metrics.},

The development of clinical pathways is a lengthy process, and may require the collaboration among physicians, nurses, and staffs in a hospital. However, the individual differences cause great variances in the execution of clinical pathways. It calls for a more dynamic and adaptive process to improve the performance of clinical pathways. This paper reports a data mining technique we have developed to discover the time dependency pattern of clinical pathways for managing brain stroke. The mining of time dependency pattern is to discover patterns of process execution sequences and to identify the dependent relation between activities in a majority of cases. By obtaining the time dependency patterns, we can predict the paths for new patients when he/she is admitted into a hospital; in turn, the health care procedure will be more effective and efficient.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Clinical pathway analysis, as a pivotal issue in ensuring specialized, standardized, normalized and sophisticated therapy procedures, is receiving increasing attention in the field of medical informatics. Clinical pathway pattern mining is one of the most important components of clinical pathway analysis and aims to discover which medical behaviors are essential/critical for clinical pathways, and also where temporal orders of these medical behaviors are quantified with numerical bounds. Even though existing clinical pathway pattern mining techniques can tell us which medical behaviors are frequently performed and in which order, they seldom precisely provide quantified temporal order information of critical medical behaviors in clinical pathways. 

METHODS
This study adopts process mining to analyze clinical pathways. The key contribution of the paper is to develop a new process mining approach to find a set of clinical pathway patterns given a specific clinical workflow log and minimum support threshold. The proposed approach not only discovers which critical medical behaviors are performed and in which order, but also provides comprehensive knowledge about quantified temporal orders of medical behaviors in clinical pathways. 

RESULTS
The proposed approach is evaluated via real-world data-sets, which are extracted from Zhejiang Huzhou Central hospital of China with regard to six specific diseases, i.e., bronchial lung cancer, gastric cancer, cerebral hemorrhage, breast cancer, infarction, and colon cancer, in two years (2007.08–2009.09). As compared to the general sequence pattern mining algorithm, the proposed approach consumes less processing time, generates quite a smaller number of clinical pathway patterns, and has a linear scalability in terms of execution time against the increasing size of data sets. 

CONCLUSION
The experimental results indicate the applicability of the proposed approach, based on which it is possible to discover clinical pathway patterns that can cover most frequent medical behaviors that are most regularly encountered in clinical practice. Therefore, it holds significant promise in research efforts related to the analysis of clinical pathways.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Clinical pathways are widely used around the world for providing quality medical treatment and controlling healthcare cost. However, the expert-designed clinical pathways can hardly deal with the variances among hospitals and patients. It calls for more dynamic and adaptive process, which is derived from various clinical data. Topic-based clinical pathway mining is an effective approach to discover a concise process model. Through this approach, the latent topics found by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) represent the clinical goals. And process mining methods are used to extract the temporal relations between these topics. However, the topic quality is usually not desirable due to the low performance of the LDA in clinical data. In this paper, we incorporate topic assignment constraint and topic correlation limitation into the LDA to enhance the ability of discovering high-quality topics. Two real-world datasets are used to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the topics discovered by our method are with higher coherence, informativeness, and coverage than the original LDA. These quality topics are suitable to represent the clinical goals. Also, we illustrate that our method is effective in generating a comprehensive topic-based clinical pathway model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
To determine the association between quality of care in process and outcome measures and in-hospital resource use among patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Japan. 

METHODS
We analyzed 23,512 AMI patients across 150 hospitals in Japan between April 2008 and March 2011. The exposure measure was inpatient hospital resource use, which was calculated from the sum of all hospital fees for healthcare services provided to AMI patients. Hospitals were then categorized into quartiles based on a risk-adjusted in-hospital resource use index. Quality of care was assessed using three process measures (in-hospital prescription of aspirin, $\beta$-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers) and two outcome measures (7-day and 30-day in-hospital mortality). Process and outcome measures were analyzed with multilevel logistic regression models that adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics. 

RESULTS
No significant differences in process measures were observed across the quartiles of in-hospital resource use. In contrast, hospitals with the lowest resource use were significantly associated with poorer outcomes (7-day in-hospital mortality OR: 1.851 [95{\%} CI 1.327–2.582]; 30-day in-hospital mortality OR: 1.706 [95{\%} CI 1.259–2.312]) than hospitals with higher resource use. 

CONCLUSION
Poorer quality of care in outcome measures was significantly associated with lower resource utilization among AMI patients in Japanese hospitals, but process measures did not show similar associations.},

abstract = {In healthcare organizational settings, the design of a clinical pathway (CP) is challenging since patients following a particular pathway may have not only one single first-diagnosis but also several typical comorbidities, and thus it requires different disciplines involved to put together their partial knowledge about the overall pathway. Although many data mining techniques have been proposed to discover latent treatment information for CP analysis and reconstruction from a large volume of clinical data, they are specific to extract nontrivial information about the therapy and treatment of the first-diagnosis. The influence of comorbidities on adopting essential treatments is crucial for a pathway but has seldom been explored. This study proposes to extract latent treatment patterns that characterize essential treatments for both first-diagnosis and typical comorbidities from the execution data of a pathway. In particular, we propose a generative statistical model to extract underlying treatment patterns, unveil the latent associations between diagnosis labels (including both first-diagnosis and comorbidities) and treatments, and compute the contribution of comorbidities in these patterns. The proposed model extends latent Dirichlet allocation with an additional layer for diagnosis modeling. It first generates a set of latent treatment patterns from diagnosis labels, followed by sampling treatments from each pattern. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on a real clinical dataset containing 12,120 patient traces, which pertain to the unstable angina CP. Three treatment patterns are discovered from data, indicating latent correlations between comorbidities and treatments in the pathway. In addition, a possible medical application in terms of treatment recommendation is provided to illustrate the potential of the proposed model. Experimental results indicate that our approach can discover not only meaningful latent treatment patterns exhibiting comorbidity focus, but also implicit changes of treatments of first-diagnosis due to the incorporation of typical comorbidities potentially.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Clinical pathway analysis, as a pivotal issue in ensuring specialized, standardized, normalized and sophisticated therapy procedures, is receiving increasing attention in the field of medical informatics. Research in clinical pathway analysis has so far mostly focused on looking at aggregated data seen from an external perspective, and only provide very limited insight into the pathways. In some recent work, process mining techniques have been studied in discovering clinical pathway models from data. While it is interesting, discovered models may provide too much detail to give a comprehensive summary of the pathway. Moreover, the number of patterns discovered can be large. Alternatively, this article presents a new approach to build a concise and comprehensive summary that describes the entire structure of a clinical pathway, while revealing essential/critical medical behaviors in specific time intervals over the whole time period of the pathway. 

METHODS
The presented approach summarizes a clinical pathway from the collected clinical event log, which regularly records all kinds of patient therapy and treatment activities in clinical workflow by various hospital information systems. The proposed approach formally defines the clinical pathway summarization problem as an optimization problem that can be solved in polynomial time by using a dynamic-programming algorithm. More specifically, given an input event log, the presented approach summarizes the pathway by segmenting the observed time period of the pathway into continuous and overlapping time intervals, and discovering frequent medical behavior patterns in each specific time interval from the log. 

RESULTS
The proposed approach is evaluated via real-world data-sets, which are extracted from Zhejiang Huzhou Central hospital of China with regard to four specific diseases, i.e., bronchial lung cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and cerebral infarction, in two years (2007.08–2009.09). Although the medical behaviors contained in these logs are very diverse and heterogeneous, experimental results indicates that the presented approach is feasible to construct condensed clinical pathway summaries in polynomial time from the collected logs, and have a linear scalability against the increasing size of the logs. 

CONCLUSION
Experiments on real data-sets illustrate that the presented approach is efficient and discovers high-quality results: the observed time period of a clinical pathway is correctly segmented into a set of continuous and overlapping time intervals, in which essential/critical medical behaviors are well discovered from the event log to form the backbone of a clinical pathway. The experimental results indicate that the generated clinical pathway summary not only reveals the global structure of a pathway, but also provides a thorough understanding of the way in which actual medical behaviors are practiced in specific time intervals, which might be essential from the perspectives of clinical pathway analysis and improvement.},

After extracting numerical temporal sequences on frequencies of nursing care, similarity-based methods, such as clustering and multidimensional scaling (MDS) are applied to the data and the labels for grouping are obtained. By using the labels, rule induction is applied, and classification power of each date is estimated. The admission dates are sorted by an index of classification power, the original dataset is decomposed into subtables. Clustering, rule induction and table decomposition methods are applied to the subtables in a recursive way. The method was applied to datasets stored in hospital information system stored in 10 years.

abstract = {Contemporary information systems (e.g., WfM, ERP, CRM, SCM, and B2B systems) record business events in so-called event logs. Business process mining takes these logs to discover process, control, data, organizational, and social structures. Although many researchers are developing new and more powerful process mining techniques and software vendors are incorporating these in their software, few of the more advanced process mining techniques have been tested on real-life processes. This paper describes the application of process mining in one of the provincial offices of the Dutch National Public Works Department, responsible for the construction and maintenance of the road and water infrastructure. Using a variety of process mining techniques, we analyzed the processing of invoices sent by the various subcontractors and suppliers from three different perspectives: (1) the process perspective, (2) the organizational perspective, and (3) the case perspective. For this purpose, we used some of the tools developed in the context of the ProM framework. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of process mining in general and our algorithms and tools in particular.},

abstract = {Discovery of clinical pathway (CP) patterns has experienced increased attention over the years due to its importance for revealing the structure, semantics and dynamics of CPs, and to its usefulness for providing clinicians with explicit knowledge which can be directly used to guide treatment activities of individual patients. Generally, discovery of CP patterns is a challenging task as treatment behaviors in CPs often have a large variability depending on factors such as time, location and patient individual. Based on the assumption that CP patterns can be derived from clinical event logs which usually record various treatment activities in CP executions, this study proposes a novel approach to CP pattern discovery by modeling CPs using mixtures of an extension to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation family that jointly models various treatment activities and their occurring time stamps in CPs. Clinical case studies are performed to evaluate the proposed approach via real-world data sets recording typical treatment behaviors in patient careflow. The obtained results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach for CP pattern discovery, and indicate the promise in research efforts related to CP analysis and optimization.},

title = "Process and deviation exploration with Inductive visual Miner",
abstract = "Process mining aims to extract information from recorded process data, which can be used to gain insights into the process. This requires applying a discovery algorithm and settings its parameters, after which the discovered process model should be evaluated. Both steps may need to be repeated several times until a satisfying model is found; we refer to this as process exploration. Existing commercial tools usually do not provide models having executable semantics, thereby disallowing for accurate map evaluation, while most academic tools lack features and by the repetitive nature of process exploration, their use is tedious. In this paper, we describe a novel process exploration tool: the Inductive visual Miner . It aims to bridge this gap between commercial and academic tools, by combining the executable semantics of academic tools with the exploration support of commercial tools. It also adds animation and deviation visualisation capabilities. Keywords: Process mining, process exploration, deviation analysis",
